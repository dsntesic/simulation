# Project Battle Simulator

Hi,
I create the project in Laravel framework,

When you download project from my gitHub account,
you must install the project.

If you use Windows,
go to cmp,then position path to my project(where you downloaded)
and enter composer install(you must have composer).

Create in yore local server,database simulator.
Then copy paste env.example,rename to env and add:
DB_DATABASE = simulator,
APP_KEY=base64:ogs6UT0pDaW8yBAu7yGZieuvvZAXjReyRvnTRHFD4Y8=
Then in your cmp enter:php artisan migrate.

Thats all,
Best Regards,

Dusan Tesic
